<h1><a name="learnmore">The Marketing Calendar simplifies your marketing organization</a></h1>
<p>
	Running any marketing organization, large or small, is an ongoing challenge.  Having 
	multiple people working on multiple projects requires extraordinary communication.  It's 
	so frustrating to find that we have missed a tactic.  Someone forgets their piece of 
	the project.  I forget to do my task.  I just get overwhelmed and decide I'm not gonna 
	bother to come up with that creative tweet one day.  Holes start appearing in the plan.
</p>
<p>
	These things happen for one main reason:  Someone forgets what needs to be done.
</p>
<p>
	The Marketing Calendar simplifies your life by becoming the hub for your marketing 
	plans.  Everyone you invite can see the plans, on a calendar.  Everyone can see the 
	schedule and how each tactic fits into the overall strategic implementation.
</p>
<p>
	We have kept The Marketing Calendar a stand-alone system.  You don't need to try to 
	get up and running on an insanely expensive marketing automation system to organize 
	your team.  A specialized calendar simplifies your marketing organization.

<h1><a name="dazzlme">Your entire team shares the same marketing plan on the same calendar</a></h1>
<p>
	Marketers have developed some tried-and-true programs over the years.  Especially in 
	retail environments these programs are run annually.  But they must advance with the demands 
	of today’s customers.  
</p>
<p>
	Marketing teams perform SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat) analyses.  
	Using the analyses they develop tight strategies with detailed tactics.  There are lots of 
	details. More than a person can track in their head.  And then they need to adapt to the 
	changing tactics of competitors and feedback from customers.  With so many changing details 
	teams need a communication hub.
</p>
<p>
	You can keep doing what you’ve always done.  You’re probably emailing spreadsheets around 
	hoping that everyone looks for the changes.  Or maybe you have weekly meetings to keep 
	reviewing the same tactics.
</p>
<p>
	The Marketing Calendar acts as the hub of your marketing planning so that everyone keeps 
	informed of the details even as the details change.
</p>
<p>
	You'll enjoy the relief of knowing that your team is effectively working together.  
	Your team gets reminder notifications when they should be working on their tasks.
	Work gets done.  You hear birds singing once again.
